<p>In this project undertaken as part of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics">Google Data Analytics Specialization</a>, 
    I applied data analysis techniques using the R programming language, specifically leveraging 
    tidyverse and ggplot2 packages. The case study involved working on real-world tasks as data 
    analyst for the fictional company, Bellabeat, a manufacturer of high-tech health products 
    for women. Following the steps of the data analysis process, I addressed key questions 
    posed by the company, emphasizing the importance of asking, preparing, processing, analyzing, 
    sharing, and acting on data.

<p>As a junior data analyst in Bellabeat's marketing analytics team, I focused on a specific 
    product to analyze smart device usage data. The data exploration aimed to uncover insights 
    that could guide the company's marketing strategy. The case study provided a tangible 
    project for my portfolio, showcasing my ability to tackle real-world data challenges and 
    deliver actionable insights. Throughout the analysis, I delved into the personas and 
    products involved, providing context to the data-driven decision-making process within the 
    dynamic setting of Bellabeat.
</p>

<p>The project showcased my adeptness in utilizing R programming, along with proficiency in the 
    tidyverse and ggplot2, to conduct comprehensive data analysis and visualization. 
    By presenting my findings to Bellabeat's executive team along with high-level marketing 
    strategy recommendations, I demonstrated my ability to contribute to data-driven 
    decision-making processes.

<p>The dataset utilized for this case study is the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit">FitBit Fitness Tracker Data</a>, 
    which was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk 
    between December 3rd and December 5th, 2016. The dataset contains minute, hourly, and 
    daily information of steps taken, intensity, calories burned, and sleep time.
